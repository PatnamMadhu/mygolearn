DAY 2 ASSIGNMENT :

1.	Pub-Sub Model : API's + MSA
	Pub/sub is shorthand for publish/subscribe messaging, an asynchronous communication method in which messages are exchanged
	between applications without knowing the identity of the sender or recipient.
	Four core concepts make up the pub/sub model:
		i. Topic – An intermediary channel that maintains a list of subscribers to relay messages to that are received from publishers
	   ii. Message – Serialized messages sent to a topic by a publisher which has no knowledge of the subscribers
	  iii. Publisher – The application that publishes a message to a topic
	   iv. Subscriber – An application that registers itself with the desired topic in order to receive the appropriate messages
	   
2.	Error vs Exception

	The term exception is shorthand for the phrase exception event. It is an event that occurs during the execution of the program and
	interrupts the normal flow of program instructions. These are the errors that occur at compile time and run time.
	It occurs in the code written by the developers. It can be recovered by using the try-catch block and throws keyword. 
	
	Errors are problems that mainly occur due to the lack of system resources. It cannot be caught or handled.
	It indicates a serious problem. It occurs at run time. An example of errors is OutOfMemoryError, LinkageError, AssertionError, etc.
