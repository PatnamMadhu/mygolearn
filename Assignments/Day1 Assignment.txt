DAY 1 ASSIGNMENT :

1. Finish Go installation

   Go is installed in my device(go version go1.18.2 windows/amd64)

2. compiled v/s interpreted languages
    A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it.Where as in Interpreted language
	the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language.
	The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.
3. Static language vs dynamic language
    In statically typed programming languages, type checking occurs at compile time. At compile time, source code in a specific programming language
	is converted to a machine-readable format. This means that before source code is compiled, the type associated with each and every single 
	variable must be known. Some common examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Java, C, C++, C# and Go.
	
	In dynamically typed languages, type checking takes place at runtime or execution time. This means that variables are checked against 
	types only when the program is executing. Some examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Python, JavaScript.
